                    <h1>Monstera, Swiss cheese plant</h1>
                    <p>
                        Be ready to create a lot of space even if you just have a small amount of monstera
                        because it is a powerful jungle climber. Your monstera will eventually grow from a
                        small sprout with glossy leaves to a height of at least 6 feet. The monstera
                        plant has heart-shaped leaves that can be up to 12 inches broad. As the foliage
                        ages, it develops dramatic windows and deeply cut lobes that give it titles like
                        "Swiss cheese plant" and "split-leaf philodendron." A dramatic monstera will provide
                        drama and a big personality to any room that is bright and open.

                    <h3>HELP ME GROW</h3>

                    <p>
                        Your small monstera will remain growing, green, and lovely under bright,
                        filtered, or indirect light. Although its large leaves can't handle the
                        full summer heat, they will benefit from a few hours of direct sunlight in the winter.
                        While tolerating moderate illumination, this climber.
                        It will produce fewer, smaller, and less-holey leaves on elongated,
                        spindly stalks to show that it wants more sun. When the air around
                        your monstera is warmer than 70 to 75°F, it will benefit from additional
                        humidity. Your monstera will be at ease in an environment that is normal
                        to warm (65 to 80°F). To keep its leaves from drying out in the dry indoor
                        air, give it a tray of wet pebbles and a light spritz every so often.

                    <img height="50" width="50" src="img/plants/2a.png" />
                    <p>
                        During the spring and summer, let the top inch of your monstera's potting soil dry out
                        between sips. In the winter, when its development will be slower, minimise watering a
                        little, but keep an eye out for signs that it is too dry or suffering from low humidity.
                        From early spring until early fall, give your monstera a balanced fertiliser every
                        two or three weeks. Fertilize once a month in the winter.

                    <p>
                        To replicate the trees monstera clambers on in its natural habitat, provide a
                        strong climbing post coated in moss. As your monstera spreads upward, gently attach stems to
                        the post and direct aerial roots into the moss.
                        Please use Polish: To keep them clean and at their best, regularly wipe the glossy leaves of
                        your monstera with a moist cloth.

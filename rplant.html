                    <h1>Monstera, Swiss cheese plant</h1>
                    <p>
                        Be ready to create a lot of space even if you just have a small amount of monstera
                        because it is a powerful jungle climber. Your monstera will eventually grow from a
                        small sprout with glossy leaves to a height of at least 6 feet. The monstera
                        plant has heart-shaped leaves that can be up to 12 inches broad. As the foliage
                        ages, it develops dramatic windows and deeply cut lobes that give it titles like
                        "Swiss cheese plant" and "split-leaf philodendron." A dramatic monstera will provide
                        drama and a big personality to any room that is bright and open.

                    <p>
                        Your small monstera will remain growing, green, and lovely under bright,
                        filtered, or indirect light. Although its large leaves can't handle the
                        full summer heat, they will benefit from a few hours of direct sunlight in the winter.
                        While tolerating moderate illumination, this climber.
                        It will produce fewer, smaller, and less-holey leaves on elongated,
                        spindly stalks to show that it wants more sun. When the air around
                        your monstera is warmer than 70 to 75°F, it will benefit from additional
                        humidity. Your monstera will be at ease in an environment that is normal
                        to warm (65 to 80°F). To keep its leaves from drying out in the dry indoor
                        air, give it a tray of wet pebbles and a light spritz every so often.

                    <p>
                        During the spring and summer, let the top inch of your monstera's potting soil dry out
                        between sips. In the winter, when its development will be slower, minimise watering a
                        little, but keep an eye out for signs that it is too dry or suffering from low humidity.
                        From early spring until early fall, give your monstera a balanced fertiliser every
                        two or three weeks. Fertilize once a month in the winter.

                    <p>
                        To replicate the trees monstera clambers on in its natural habitat, provide a
                        strong climbing post coated in moss. As your monstera spreads upward, gently attach stems to
                        the post and direct aerial roots into the moss.
                        Please use Polish: To keep them clean and at their best, regularly wipe the glossy leaves of
                        your monstera with a moist cloth.

                    <h1>Aloe vera</h1>
                    <p>
                        It is commonly known that the gel-like substance found inside the succulent leaves of
                        aloe plants has soothing effects on the skin. Aloe is still sought after by those with
                        sunburns who need soothing relief because Cleopatra supposedly employed it in her beauty
                        regimen. If healing that painful burn isn't enough, aloe has another clever trick to
                        show off: it will reward your tender attention with cuddly grand-aloes, or pups.
                    </p>

                    <img height="50" width="50" src="img/plants/1a.png" />
                    <p>
                        Your aloe will benefit from bright light, such as that coming from a south-facing window.
                        Aloe is adaptable to most common household temperatures and isn't finicky about humidity.
                        Wintertime cooler temperatures, less watering, and a break in feedings provide it a
                        healthy nap time.
                        For keeping aloe comfortable in its pot, use a well-drained, sandy to gritty
                        soil-based potting mix. The risk of rotting is decreased by adding a layer of
                        pebbles or coarse sand on top of the soil to assist moisture drain out fast from
                        the base of the leaves.

                <div id="plantPart3">
                    <h3>FEED ME</h3>
                    <img height="50" width="50" src="img/plants/2a.png" />
                    <p>
                        In between waterings, let the top inch of the soil in the plant's container dry out.
                        Aloe prefers even moisture, but a wet environment makes it unhappy and susceptible to
                        rot. Reduce irrigation during the winter.
                        From spring until the beginning of fall, fertilise aloe monthly with houseplant
                        fertiliser. During the cooler months, when its development will slow down, give your
                        aloe a rest from fertilisation. Resuming in the spring when the light is more abundant.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        If your aloe is happy, it will generate pups, also known as baby plants
                        or offsets, which grow from the main plant's base.
                        Separate the pups from the ecstatic parent aloe using a sharp knife, and then let the wounded
                        surfaces heal for a day or two before planting them in individual pots.<br />
                        The key is consistency: If you take care of aloe, which is long-lasting and easy to cultivate,
                        it will be your chlorophyll friend for a very long time. Aloe thrives in bright light, but oddly,
                        if you transfer it suddenly from indoors to outside, the sun might burn it. Aloe can become sad
                        and pale when moved to a location with less light.

                    <h1>Palm</h1>
                    <p>
                        In the Victorian times, palms gained popularity as indoor plants, but these ancient,
                        primarily tropical plants are still attractive complements to any home with enough
                        room and care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, if your bouncing young sprout is a palm with vertical growth potential,
                        you'll want to make sure you have plenty of area. A palm species that grows
                        enormous in an outdoor setting may remain at more manageable heights when limited
                        by a pot. Because of the manner that palms develop, trimming them back when they
                        get too tall won't suffice because it may harm or even kill the plant.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="plantPart2">
                    <h3>HELP ME GROW</h3>
                    <img height="50" width="50" src="img/plants/1a.png" />
                    <p>
                        Most palms will grow in bright light, including a few hours of direct sunlight each
                        day, but each species has different lighting requirements.
                        A sudden change in the light can send your palm into a dark,
                        highly dangerous depression. The palm that you bring home is probably a young plant
                        that would typically be covered by higher vegetation. It has also become used to
                        life and light indoors, so it won't be happy to discover itself in direct sunlight
                        on a balcony. A palm that has been growing outside may also suffer if it is suddenly
                        relocated into a room with poor illumination. Keep palms that spend the summer
                        outdoors in a shady area and gradually adjust their posture.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="plantPart3">

                    <p>
                        If you feed your palm drinks of distilled, filtered, or rainfall, it will be happiest.
                        Palms might be a little picky about their water. Most palms have modest feeding needs
                        that are best met with a spring serving of slow-release fertiliser and occasionally
                        adding compost to the surface of their potting mix. Watering needs vary by species,
                        but most enjoy lightly moist soil during the spring and summer months and reduced
                        watering in fall and winter, when growth typically slows. Too much fertiliser might
                        harm the roots of your palm by causing salts to build up in the potting soil.
                        It is useful to flush away extra salts from the soil a few times per year by
                        flooding it with water, letting it drain, and then repeating the process.

                        The Kentia palm is a gorgeous upright palm with glossy, dark green leaves that can reach
                        heights of 8 feet or more. However, due to its slow growth, it may take many years before
                        its fronds brush your ceiling.
                        The Kentia palm can tolerate low lighting but prefers bright, indirect light. Your kentia
                        palm will increase extremely slowly in low light exposures. If your kentia displays pale
                        foliage and laziness, it may be too dark; add more light or place it next to a window with good light.
                        Kentia palms dislike having their rather delicate roots disturbed and want to fit tightly
                        in the pot.

                    <p>
                        Diverse dracaenas produce effects ranging from fanciful to formal with their
                        colorfully stripy ribbonlike leaves arching from stems.
                        This group of foliage plants includes forms to fit almost any decor and care
                        requirements even novice plant parents can handle. Most dracaenas produce
                        their pointed leaves in a spiral pattern around a woody stem that culminates
                        in a rosette of foliage. As plants age, they tend to lose their lower leaves,
                        exposing a stem decorated bu triangular leaf scars; the resulting effect is
                        palmlike, but easier to care for.

                        While your dracaena can survive in low light, it won't grow up to make you
                        proud without adequate lighting. Pale leaves and fading stripes are signs that
                        conditions are too dim.

                        The handsome corn plant (Dracaena fragrans 'Massangeana') has arching, broad,
                        pointed leaves with lengthwise yellow stripes that bear a resemblance to the
                        leaves of corn in the field. This effect is heightened by the dracaena's sturdy,
                        upright habit; mature plants may reach 6 feet tall.
                        The narrow leaves of Madagascar dragon tree (Dracaena marginata) are dark
                        green with thin red-purple edges; the variety 'Tricolor' has narrow stripes of
                        pink and cream running the length of its leaves. A slender, easygoing dracaena,
                        your little dragon tree can grow up to 5 feet tall to deliver an attractive

                        mop of spiky colorful leaves.
                        Although their grassy foliage may attract nibbles from your fur-family
                        members, dracaenas contain substances that are toxic to dogs and cats and
                        should be placed out of pets' reach.

                    <h1>Peace lilies</h1>
                    <p>
                        Refined good looks and modest care requirements have earned spathiphylums,
                        commonly known as peace lilies or spaths, a place in malls, offices, and
                        other commercial settings around the globe. For plant parents in need of
                        a confidence boost or those who are looking for a sprout that can make
                        the best of a low: light location, a peace lily will respond to your loving
                        care with a fountain of glossy green leaves and long-lasting white tear-drop-shaped
                        spathes, each clasped around a creamy yellow flower stalk. Varieties range
                        from towering 6-footers to petite selections that may grow no more than 12
                        inches tall.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="plantPart2">
                    <h3>HELP ME GROW</h3>
                    <img height="50" width="50" src="img/plants/1a.png" />
                    <p>
                        Adaptability to a range of lighting conditions has contributed to peace lily's
                        popularity; it will get along under artificial lights and in moderate natural
                        lighting, as from a north-facing window.
                        Your own pretty peace lily will be happier, though, if it receives moderate to
                        bright, indirect light, at least in spring and summer when it is actively growing.
                        Peace lily may develop brown, dried patches on its foliage in response to too much
                        direct sun.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="plantPart3">
                    <h3>FEED ME</h3>
                    <img height="50" width="50" src="img/plants/2a.png" />
                    <p>
                        Water your peace lily when the top half inch of its potting soil has dried out.
                        Evenly, lightly moist soil throughout spring and summer will keep your spath happy.
                        In winter, water less frequently, but don't let the soil dry out completely.
                        Your peace lily will signal extreme thirst by drooping dramatically and will
                        recover equally dramatically when you supply it with water. But repeated wilting
                        is tough on any plant.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Give your baby a warm shower once in a while to freshen its foliage and,
                        in between showers, gently wipe leaves clean with a damp cloth.
                        More, please: A peace lily that wilts often in spite of appropriate watering
                        may be telling you its roots are too crowded. Divide very pot-bound plants in
                        spring, carefully separating clumps of leaves attached to shallow rhizomes.
                        Replant at the same depth in fresh potting soil. Let divisions settle in for
                        2-3 months before fertilizing.
                    </p>
